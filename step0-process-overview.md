## STEP 0: Here are some questions that we will need to answer when preparing our event:


# A) Before the event

1. Under *which Code of Conduct* ("CoC") are we running our event? The [Berlin Code of Conduct](http://berlincodeofconduct.org) perhaps? 
2. Who will be responsible for the enforcement on location? Who's is our "*Code of Conduct Team*"?
2. How do we *make sure speakers and attendees know* that we expect them to behave according to that Code of Conduct?
3. How do we *help speakers* avoid typical pitfalls and provide welcoming presentations?
4. How do people *report incidents* during and after the event?
5. What is an *adequate reaction* in case of report (within what time frame? by whom? in what way?)
6. How do we make sure severe "offenders" are *kept out of the way*?
7. How do we make sure the targeted *people are still ok* after something happened?

This is a lot , I know. I promise the rewards will be great though!


# B) During and after the conference, including outside the regular schedule (e.g. dinner time between conference days)

1. *Who* is around and available of the CoC committee?
2. How can CoC committee members *prepare for questions* and negative reactions about the CoC during the event?
3. What will their role exactly be? Where do their *responsibilities* start, where do they end?
4. How do we *introduce the committee* to the participants and what it can do for them? How do you ensure people know how they can *report incidents*?
5. How do we react to *post-event reports*?

Highly recommended:
Hold a *retrospective meeting* with those involved in the CoC implementation so you can sync about and learn from the latest experience.
