# What to prepare for

This is a *short* list of incidents that are routinely happening and harm our communities' diversity. So, we may want to consider them in our Code of Conduct and prepare *adequate* responses.
What is "adequate"? The Code of Conduct team, who will enforce the CoC, can get together and agree about the following beforehand:
- What can we do?
- Within what timeframe do we want to take action?
- Who will take care of the issue?

Incidents come in various forms and degrees of severity:

*Major incidents:*
insults, stalking, unwanted physical contact, sexual harassment, physical abuse

*Minor incidents:* 
sexual imagery, descriptors that refer to personal attributes such as race, gender, sexual orientation, disability or age for example, that tend to overemphasize and draw undue attention to the distinguishing attribute unless they are valid and important for the context.


So, here are some recurring issues, in no particular order:

- Sexual/suggestive content/imagery on a speaker's outfit:
*What can we do?* Let the speaker put on a neutral/volunteer/staff T-shirt on top of theirs.
*When?* Immediately after report, latest before the speaker steps up on stage.
