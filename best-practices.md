These are practices that proved effective in setting the tone for an event, welcoming a more diverse crowd 
and making it feel like a true community gathering:

# Making sure no one can miss our Code of Conduct.
From the very first contact for potential participants (e.g. landing page on the website), 
to various steps towards and while attending. This makes a great difference in who will want to join and how participants 
will behave. Everyone can then expect certain standards of communication and interaction.

Having speakers commit to reviewing and adjusting their upcoming performance according to these standards.

Having participants commit to these standards as well, right when booking their spot.

# Making sure that our commitment is not just talk.
Getting members of underrepresented and marginalized groups on board while planning the event, to make sure their needs are met.

Making sure that the event line-up includes a diverse crowd.
Inviting members of underrepresented and marginalized groups to make technical contributions. It shows that we care about these. 

Inviting speakers who can contribute input on professional and people topics as well.

Making sure that the Code of Conduct team has a good awareness of the issues that can occur 
and are mentally prepared to react adequately.

Intervening swiftly and mindfully whenever there is a report, or when the team itself witnesses unwelcoming/harmful behaviour.

Making sure that the Code of Conduct team is made of a diverse crowd.

Paying special attention to isolated and/or particularly vulnerable participants and their needs.

Getting the event's partners on board (venue staff, hotel staff, security staff, etc.).

# Making it easy to report incidents.
Introducing both the Code of Conduct process and the Code of Conduct team at the welcoming address. It helps build trust.

Putting up signs in all bathrooms explaining how to report incidents.

Making the Code of Conduct team visible via buttons, special coloured T-shirts/badges/lanyards.

Creating a mailing list to report incidents so they are automatically forwarded to the people whose responsibily is to take care of them (and to no one else).

Making sure that the team is also accessible in person throughout the event, including during breaks and other informal times.

Making vulnerable people's safety and well-being a priority over the comfort of misbehaving participants.

# Anything missing?
